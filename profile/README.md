# KRM Functions

This purpose of this organisation is to provide generally usable
functions for operating on configuration-as-code using the Kubernetes
Resource Model (KRM) as defined in [KRM Functions
Specification](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/api-conventions/functions-spec.md).

For a general introduction to using KRM functions see [Replacing Helm and Kustomize with KRM Functions â€” a New Approach to Configuration Management](https://medium.com/@michael.vittrup.larsen/replacing-helm-and-kustomize-with-krm-functions-a-new-approach-to-configuration-management-676212cc1332).

For an broader description on how to use and develop new KRM functions see [the kpt book](https://kpt.dev/book/).
